*Beat Your Prisoners* lets you... well, beat the hell out of your prisoners. You can use this to speed up recruitment time, train melee skill, or purely for amusement.

**As always, I appreciate any feedback you can give on this mod. For this one I could especially use feedback on balance aspects, such as whether beatings need to be more/less effective, are the mood penalties reasonable, do prisoners fight back or prison break too often, etc.**

## Details

[hr][/hr]
Adds a new work type called "Break". Pawns set to break will occasionally go beat up prisoners who are marked for "Reduce Resistance". This will reduce the resistance of the prisoner in addition to any recruiting being done by wardens.

Prisoners may fight back depending on their traits and melee skill. If they fight back, the beating will last until they are downed.

If the prisoner should down their assailant, there is a 50% chance they will immediately trigger a prison break, so make sure your breakers are well armed and/or capable fighters.

When the beating is complete, the prisoners resistance will be reduced based on the pain received during the beating, the negotiation skill of the breaker, and the traits of both the prisoner and the breaker.

Beating prisoners gives a stackable colony-wide mood penalty to most colonists.

Prisoners will only be beaten when at full health, and breakers will deliver no more than 2 beatings in 24 hours.

**[u]Base chance of fighting back (checked on each attack received):[/u]**
(5% + (2% x melee skill))

**[u]Traits that affect beatings:[/u]**
*Masochist* - Loves to be beaten, will never fight back, easier to "break".
*Wimp* - Greater mood penalty from being beaten, less likely to fight back, less effective at breaking, easier to break.
*Kind* - Greater mood penalty when prisoner beaten, less likely to fight back, less effective at breaking.
*Brawler* -  Loves to give beatings, more likely to fight back, more effective at breaking, harder to break.
*Bloodlust* - Mood buff when prisoner beaten, loves to give beatings, more likely to fight back, more effective at breaking, harder to break.
*Psychopath* - More effective at breaking, harder to break.
*Tough* - Harder to break.
